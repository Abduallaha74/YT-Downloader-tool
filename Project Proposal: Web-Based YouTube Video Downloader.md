1. Project Planning & Management

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a web-based tool that allows users to download YouTube videos by entering a video URL. The system will fetch the best resolution and store the downloaded video inside a mounted volume within a containerized environment.

Objectives

•	Develop a user-friendly web interface for downloading YouTube videos.
•	Ensure high-quality video resolution selection.
•	Implement a secure and efficient storage mechanism inside a container.
•	Deploy the system using Docker for portability and scalability.

Scope

•	Users can input a YouTube URL and receive a downloadable file.
•	The system will fetch the highest available resolution.
•	Videos will be stored inside a mounted volume in a container.
•	The solution will be web-based and accessible via a browser.
