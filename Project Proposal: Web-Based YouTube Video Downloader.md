4. System Analysis & Design 

1. Problem Statement & Objectives

Problem Statement: With the vast amount of content available on YouTube, users often seek ways to download videos for offline viewing, educational purposes, or content archiving. However, YouTube does not provide a native feature for downloading videos, leading users to rely on third-party applications that may be unreliable, lack user-friendliness, or pose security risks.

Objectives:

Develop a user-friendly web application that enables users to download YouTube videos by entering the video URL.
Ensure the application fetches videos in the highest available resolution.
Implement a secure and efficient storage mechanism for downloaded videos within a containerized environment.
Deploy the application using Docker to ensure portability and scalability.

2. Use Case Diagram & Descriptions

3. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements:

The system shall allow users to input a YouTube video URL.
The system shall validate the correctness of the provided URL.
The system shall retrieve and display available video resolutions and formats.
The system shall enable users to select their preferred video quality.
The system shall download the selected video and store it securely.

Compliance: The application must comply with YouTube's terms of service and copyright regulations.

4. Software Architecture

Architecture Style: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

Components:

Model:

Manages the data and business logic related to video downloads.
Interacts with external APIs or libraries to fetch video data.
Handles storage of downloaded videos within the containerized environment.
View:

Represents the user interface of the web application.
Provides forms for URL input and displays available video quality options.
Shows download progress and provides links to downloaded videos.
Controller:

Handles user input and interactions.
Validates input data and coordinates between the Model and View components.
Manages the workflow of fetching video metadata, processing downloads, and storing files.
Interactions:

Users interact with the View to input URLs and select video quality.
The Controller processes user inputs, invoking the Model to handle data operations.
The Model retrieves necessary data and performs download operations, updating the Controller.
The Controller updates the View to reflect the current state and provide feedback to the user.
Deployment:

The application will be containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments.
A mounted volume within the Docker container will securely store downloaded videos.
The web application will be accessible through standard web browsers, providing cross-platform compatibility.

Wireframes & Mockups:

The UI is designed with a minimalist approach, featuring a centered input form for the YouTube URL.

A dropdown menu allows users to choose the download format (video or audio).

A green "Download" button initiates the process.

A success message appears below upon successful download.
