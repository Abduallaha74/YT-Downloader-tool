1. Project Planning & Management

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a web-based tool that allows users to download YouTube videos by entering a video URL. The system will fetch the best resolution and store the downloaded video inside a mounted volume within a containerized environment.

Objectives

•	Develop a user-friendly web interface for downloading YouTube videos.
•	Ensure high-quality video resolution selection.
•	Implement a secure and efficient storage mechanism inside a container.
•	Deploy the system using Docker for portability and scalability.

Scope

•	Users can input a YouTube URL and receive a downloadable file.
•	The system will fetch the highest available resolution.
•	Videos will be stored inside a mounted volume in a container.
•	The solution will be web-based and accessible via a browser.

User Stories & Use Cases

User Stories:

1.	As a user, I want to enter a YouTube URL and download the best quality video.
2.	As an admin, I want to manage storage and delete old videos.

Use Case Example:

Title: Download YouTube Video Actors: User, System Precondition: User has a YouTube video URL. Steps:

1.	User inputs URL
2.	System fetches video metadata
3.	System processes and stores video
4.	User downloads the video

Functional Requirements

•	Input field for video URL.
•	Automatic fetching of highest resolution.
•	Download button with storage integration.
•	Error handling for invalid URLs.

Non-Functional Requirements

•	Performance: Must process videos within 3 seconds.
•	Security: Secure data handling & prevent unauthorized access.
•	Usability: Intuitive and accessible user interface.
•	Reliability: Ensure system uptime of 99.9%.


4. System Analysis & Design 

1.Problem Statement & Objectives – Define the problem being solved and project 
goals.

• Use Case Diagram & Descriptions – Identify system actors and interactions.
• Functional & Non-Functional Requirements – Clearly state system capabilities 
and constraints.
• Software Architecture – High-level design outlining system components, 
interactions, and architecture style (e.g., MVC, Microservices).

2. Database Design & Data Modeling

![ER_Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de7907d3-4c1e-4f08-9cdb-33a45b7969bd)




• ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship Diagram) – A well-defined ERD showcasing 
database structure and relationships.
• Logical & Physical Schema – Tables, attributes, keys, and normalization 
considerations.






3. Data Flow & System Behavior

![DFD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6879344-6636-4ddc-9fcd-ce19b1e3d413)


 
• DFD (Data Flow Diagram) – Context-level and detailed levels showing how 
data moves through the system.
• Sequence Diagrams – Process flow representation of key interactions between 
components.
• Activity Diagram – Visualizing the workflow of processes or user actions within 
the system.
• State Diagram – Represents different states of an object and how it transitions 
between them.
• Class Diagram – Defines the structure of the system by showing classes, 
attributes, methods, and relationships.








4. UI/UX Design & Prototyping

Wireframes & Mockups:

The UI is designed with a minimalist approach, featuring a centered input form for the YouTube URL.

A dropdown menu allows users to choose the download format (video or audio).

A green "Download" button initiates the process.

A success message appears below upon successful download.

UI/UX Guidelines:

Design Principles: Simple, intuitive, and clean layout.

Color Scheme: White and gray background for contrast with black text and green buttons.

Typography: Clear and bold font for easy readability.

Accessibility Considerations: Large input fields and buttons for usability across devices.
